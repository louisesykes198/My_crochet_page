-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are a light blue, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Nunito Sans font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Nunito Sans is a clean font used and Sans Serif frequently used in programming, so there are both attractive and appropriate.

           Imagery is crucial. The large background hero image is intended to be stunning and draw the user's attention. It also has a trendy and vibrant look.
