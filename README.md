### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

     As a First Time Visitor, I want them to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. When entering the site, users are greeted with a clean and easy to read navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Under the navigation bar there is a background image, text a "ask a question" and "Learn More" call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the background image
        3. To find out more about the organisation, the user has two options: either scroll down or click the call to action buttons, which will take them to the same location.

     As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The navigation bar is clear labled so the user knows which part of the page they will be taken to.
        2. Tere is a "Back nto Top " call for action button that appears when you ether scroll or click a navigation button that will return the user back to the top of the page.
        3. On the Contact Me Page, when the user has filled in the require text areas and click on the submit button it will take them to a page that says "Thank you your question will be answered shortly".
