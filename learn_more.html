       <h3 class="sub_headings" >What is Crochet?</h3>
       <p>Crochet is a fun, relaxing hobby that anyone can do!
       Crochet is a type of needlecraft in which you use a hook to create fabric from loops of yarn. Crochet can be used to make everything from blankets and scarves to hats and sweaters. If you’re looking for a fun, creative way to spend your free time, crochet may be the perfect activity for you!<p>
     
       <p>Crochet has been around for centuries and is still one of the most popular yarn crafts today. It is a method of creating a looped fabric from yarn with a crochet hook.
       It’s not difficult to learn how to crochet, but it can be a little tricky in the beginning. Like learning any new skill, mastering crochet will take a fair bit of perseverance and patience.<p>
       
       <p>To learn crochet, start with the fundamental techniques and a few basic stitches. Then, once you’ve mastered them, you can move on to intermediate and advanced techniques.
       Once you’ve learned the basics of crochet, you can make all sorts of cozy crocheted items, from baby booties to granny squares.</p>
       
       <h3 class="sub_headings" >What do you need to start crocheting?</h3>
       <p>One of the great things about crochet is that you don’t need many tools to get started. In fact, you only need these two things:<p>
        <ol class="tools" >
          <li>A crochet hook</li>
       <li>Yarn</li>  
          <li>Stitch Markers</li> 
        </ol>
       <p>The right tools can make learning easier. Set yourself up for success by choosing hooks and yarns that are easy to work with. Here are my recommendations for the best crochet supplies for beginners.</p>
       
       <p>Yarn comes in many different weights: from super-fine baby-weight yarn all the way up to bulky-weight wool. Different patterns will recommend various types of yarns. But for beginners, I recommend using medium-weight (number four) acrylic, wool, or cotton yarn. You can buy this type of yarn online, or at any craft store!, 
       •	Medium yarn weight. I recommend that beginners choose a worsted-weight yarn.
       •	Smooth texture. It’s easier to see your stitches when you use a ball of simple, smooth wool or acrylic yarn.
       •	Light color. It can be hard to see exactly where to insert the hook when you use dark or multicolor yarn.
       Some of my favorite yarns to teach with are Bernat Maker Home Dec and Swish Worsted from WeCrochet.com
       Crochet Hook
       Crochet hooks come in a range of sizes, shapes, and materials. The most important thing to remember is to match the size of the hook to the weight of the yarn. Use larger crochet hooks with thicker yarns and smaller crochet hooks with thinner yarns.
