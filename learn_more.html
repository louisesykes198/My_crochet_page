       <h3 class="sub_headings" >What is Crochet?</h3>
       <p>Crochet is a type of textile craft that involves using a hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or other materials to create fabric. The name comes from the French word "crochet," meaning "hook." Unlike knitting, which uses two needles, crochet is done with just one hook.
        There are various techniques in crochet, and it can be used to make a wide range of items such as clothing, blankets, toys (amigurumi), and accessories like bags or hats. Crocheted fabrics can be dense or delicate depending on the stitches and materials used. Common stitches include chain stitch, slip stitch, single crochet, and double crochet.

       <h3 class="sub_headings" >Where to Start?</h3>
       <p>Starting to crochet is simple and rewarding! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you begin:
        <h5>1. Gather Your Supplies</h5>
        <p>You'll need just a few basic tools to get started:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Crochet Hook: For beginners, a medium-sized hook (such as a size H/8 or 5mm) is recommended.</li>
       <li>Yarn: Choose a smooth, medium-weight yarn (like worsted weight) in a light color so you can easily see your stitches.</li>
       <li>	Scissors: A small pair to cut your yarn.</li>
        <li>Yarn Needle: This is optional for weaving in ends, but it's helpful.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>2. Learn Basic Crochet Stitches</h5>
        <p>Start by learning the fundamental stitches. The most common ones are:</p>
        <ol>
       <li>Slip Knot: This is how you'll attach the yarn to the hook to begin your project.</li>
        <li>Single Crochet (sc): One of the simplest and most versatile stitches.</li>
        <li>	Double Crochet (dc): Taller than a single crochet, this stitch creates an airy texture.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>3. Practice Your Tension</h5>
        <p>Maintaining even tension is key to creating neat crochet projects. As you practice, work on holding the yarn consistently and controlling how tight or loose your stitches are.</p>
       <h5>4. Follow a Simple Pattern</h5>
        <p>Once you're comfortable with basic stitches, try following a simple pattern like a scarf, coaster, or dishcloth. These beginner projects are great for building confidence and improving your technique.</p>
        <h5>5. Keep Learning</h5>
        <p>As you practice, you'll learn new stitches and techniques, such as how to increase and decrease stitches, change colours, or read more complex patterns.</p>
        <h5>6. Join the Crochet Community</h5>
        <p>Crocheting is more fun when your part of a community! Join online crochet groups, follow tutorials, or attend local crochet meet-ups to stay inspired and motivated.
        With just a bit of practice, you'll be creating beautiful crochet projects in no time!
